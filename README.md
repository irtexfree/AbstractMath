# AbstractMath
Welcome to the abstract branch of the mathematical calculation type

AbstractMath is not a science or branch of mathematics, it is just a method of calculation in a more abstract way, suitable for fast conversion to Octave and Python programs.

The AbstractMath repository is designed to quickly learn the type of calculations, the designation of formulas and the assignment of some of them 

## Step 1
In the abstract representation of calculus there is a tree of names of entities. The higher the level, the less abstract the entity is.
