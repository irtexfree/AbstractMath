# AbstractMath

> AbstractMath is not a branch in mathematics, it is only a way of presenting mathematics in abstract form with its methods of human and machine solution of mathematical problems.

Welcome to the abstract branch of the mathematical calculation type

AbstractMath is not a science or branch of mathematics, it is just a method of calculation in a more abstract way, suitable for fast conversion to Octave and Python or TypeScript programs.

The AbstractMath repository is designed to quickly learn the type of calculations, the designation of formulas and the assignment of some of them 

## Abstraction levels
In the abstract representation of calculus there is a tree of names of entities. The higher the level, the less abstract the entity is.

## Parsing mathematical expressions

Parsing and processing mathematical expressions is the most voluminous part of AbstractMath. The branch aims at standardizing expressions for machine and human computing.

In AbstractMath all expressions are read as a program with their environment. Variables, formulas or macros can be used as the environment.
